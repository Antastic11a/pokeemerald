## TODO
- Sort ideas into TODO that come first.
1. Remove RNG

## Remove RNG
- [x] Remove / Adjust Crits
    - See CalcCritChanceStage
    - Changed Crits so they have to be 2+ to Crit and it'll Crit 100% of the time.
- [x] Remove Damage Variance
- [x] Multi-hit moves always hit for max amound (or 4 times?)
    - Loaded Dice always hits 5 times.
    - Multi-hits default to 3.
- Accuracy
    - [x] Change the formula to ignore accuracy checks.
    - [ ] Change evasion to effect physical and special defense at half the rate of a normal defense boost.
- Status effects
    - [ ] Paralysis
        - Options / Ideas
            - Speed drop stays, every third turn on switch in, the target can't move.
                - I kinda like this, it encourages swapping out and "reads" in general because of that.
            - Target always goes last.
    - [ ] Sleep
        - Options / Ideas
            - Drowsy from LA
                - The Pokémon receives increased damage from attacks
                - (Unlike LA) Speed drop stays, every third turn on switch in, the target can't move.
                - Drowsiness can be removed when the opponent or user uses the moves: Spark, Volt Tackle, Wild Charge
    - [ ] Confusion
        - Options / Ideas
            - Confusion lasts 1 turn consistantly and Confusion always makes the target hit themself.
            - Confusion lasts 2 turns, every attack misses, moves that don't target still work (like Recover).
- [ ] Either remove secondary effects on moves or make them 100%.
- General
    - Search battle_util.c and battle_script_commands.c for RandomWeight and RandomUniform
- If I keep the same-ish world
    - [ ] Make Feebas reasonably obtainable.

## In response to the removal of RNG
- Prior low accuracy + high power need to be nurfed in some way.
    - [ ] Reduce PP of high power moves to 3 or something.
    - [ ] Remove PP UP
    - [ ] Restore PP at the start of every battle.
- Buff early game low base power moves.
    - Ideas
        - Moves like Ember, if they hit the target twice, they trigger a status effect.


## More use out of Pre-evo Pokemon
- Manual Evolution like LA
- More Evolite like items
    - Eviolite scales with how much of a pre-evo it is.

## Cool shtuff
- Balance Pokemon
    - What approach am I going to take to this?
        - Approaches
            - Allow for the adjustment of everything.
                -

- [ ] Amplify the effects of EVs for a stronger sense of customizability.
- [ ] Remove IVs
    - What do I do about Hidden Power?
        - Remove Hidden Power (probably for the best).
            - [ ] Add a replacement move that functions identically to Hidden Power except you choose the type.
                - I don't know how I'd implement this with menus.
                - Perhaps once they know the move, when you select the Pokemon in the party, there's an option to adjust the type like how field moves are visible.
- Items to change the whole Pokemon's type (maybe just change the Plates to work on all Pokemon?)
    - Another Item to change their second type.
- [x] Change default settings to be fast text and set battles

    - [ ] Speedy Nurse Joy
        - [Tutorial](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Speedy-Nurse-Joy)
- [ ] All battles are double battles
    - I think the game is made for double battles more and I think the synergies between Pokemon become more exagerated and more interesting.
    - [ ] Only allow 4 Pokemon to be able to be brought to a battle out of a party of 6 (like VGC).
- Rogue-like aspects? ( What am I thinking here? )

    - [Tutorial](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald/wiki/Colored-stats-by-nature-in-summary-screen)
- [ ] DS Style Party Screens.
    - If I go with all double battles this will look better than the current party screen.

    - These can get grading.
    - [Tutorial](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10246778&postcount=194)

    - I might want to change this later to IV and EV editing as apposed to just viewing.
    - [Tutorial](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showpost.php?p=10161688&postcount=77)
- [ ] Show Type Effectiveness In Battle Using Pre Existing Function and Disable in Option Menu

## Core Ideas
- [ ] No RNG!
- [ ] Lean into the competitive nature of Pokemon more.

## Potential Core Ideas
- [ ] More Balenced (all Pokemon are usable)
    - Questions
        - Do I want Legendaries on the same competitive level as regular Pokemon?
        - Do I adjust the levels of Pokemon evolution to match eachother more with this balance?
            - Otherwise Pokemon that evolve early like Beedrill (LV 10) will be super powerful early on.
- Exploration?
    - This is taking a back seat to No RNG and More Balance but it'd feel wrong to take it away from a Pokemon game.
    - What does Exploration include?
        - Exploring the map
        - Finding new Pokemon
        - Finding new Items

## Gameplay ideas
- Rouge-like, bug-catching-competition-like Gym challenges?
    - For a Gym you can bring 2 returning Pokemon.
        - This encourages changing up team strategy each gym while still maintaining some progression.
    - You catch the remaining Pokemon during the challenge to fill out your party.
    - You have access to all the team building tools during the challenge.
        - Adjusting EVs, Moves, Abilities, Items on the fly.
    - What becomes of Routes with this idea? Everything seems to centralize around gyms (might not be a bad thing).
- Don't overload the player with trainer battles, especially if I make this the way I want where battles are more time consuming, thought provoking experiences.
- Other type Pixilate Abilities.
    - I don't know what Pokemon I'd give this to.
- After a certain amount of turns (idk, like 20 or something?) a mechanic tries to end the game.
    - This is to prevent battles from taking too long and getting uninteresting.
    - Mechanic ideas
        - Attack buffs start getting piled on.
        - Damage is applied overtime (like Poison status or Sandstorm (not literaly)).
- Put Blueprints in the overworld to build items (I'm not too sure about this idea).
- Slow introduction of mechanics (particularly new mechanics) over the gym challenge.
    - New mechanics
- Saved team compositions and individual Pokemon
    - This might be real tricky, there's a lot to implement with this.
        - Save data
            - Store each whole Pokemon.
        - Stored Pokemon UI
            - Maybe I could piggyback off the PC UI?

## Questions
- Where do I draw the line with "Lean into the competitive nature of Pokemon"?
- Do I want to balance around the AI or PVP.
    - I'm leaning towards the AI, I don't think this'll be play PvP often.
